## 🆘 IF SOMETHING FAILS

### Backend Won't Start
```powershell
# Check what's using port 8001
netstat -ano | findstr :8001

# Kill if needed (replace PID with actual number)
taskkill /PID 1234 /F

# Try again
python ultra_simple_server.py
```

### Flutter Won't Connect
```powershell
# Verify backend is running
curl http://localhost:8001/

# If not running, start backend first
python ultra_simple_server.py

# Then run Flutter
flutter run
```

### Search Returns No Results
```
1. Check city name (must be exact, case-insensitive)
2. Available cities: Goa, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, etc.
3. Check budget is reasonable
4. Try simpler search first (just city and budget)
```

### App Closes Unexpectedly
```powershell
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## 💡 HOW IT WORKS (Simple Version)

```
User Opens App
    ↓
    Backend Available? → Check localhost:8001
    ✅ Yes → Continue
    ❌ No → Show Error
    ↓
User Enters: City + Budget
    ↓
Click Search
    ↓
Send to Backend (JSON Request)
    ↓
Backend Decides:

    ↓
Backend Finds Hotels
    ↓
Return to Flutter (JSON Response)
    ↓
Flutter Displays 2-7 Hotels
    ↓
User Can:
  • Swipe to browse
