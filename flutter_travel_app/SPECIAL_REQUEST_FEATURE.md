# Special Request / AI Prompt Feature

## Overview
The app now supports AI-powered special requests where users can ask for specific preferences, and the AI will help filter and recommend hotels accordingly.

## How It Works

### 1. **User Interface**
- Located in the home screen search form (all tabs: Hotels, Flights, Destinations)
- Multi-line text field labeled "Special Requests (Optional)"
- Placeholder: "E.g., Early check-in, high floor, quiet room..."

### 2. **AI Processing Flow**
When a user enters a special request and clicks "Search Hotels":

```
User Input ‚Üí Home Screen ‚Üí Search Hotels Screen ‚Üí AI Agent ‚Üí Hotel Search ‚Üí Results
```

**Example Requests:**
- "I need a hotel with sea view and near the beach"
- "Looking for budget-friendly hotel with good breakfast"
- "I want a luxury hotel with spa facilities"
- "Need a hotel near the airport with late check-out"
- "Pet-friendly hotel with parking space"

### 3. **Backend Integration**
```dart
// In search_hotels_screen.dart
if (_specialRequest.isNotEmpty) {
  final aiResponse = await _api.sendMessage(
    'I am looking for hotels in $_selectedCity. Special request: $_specialRequest. '
    'Check-in: ${_checkIn}, Check-out: ${_checkOut}, '
    'Guests: $_guests, Rooms: $_rooms',
  );
  // AI processes the request and provides recommendations
}
```

### 4. **Data Flow**

#### Home Screen ‚Üí Search Hotels
```dart
Get.toNamed('/search-hotels', arguments: {
  'from': _fromController.text,
  'city': _toController.text,
  'checkIn': _checkInDate,
  'checkOut': _checkOutDate,
  'guests': _guests,
  'rooms': _rooms,
  'specialRequest': _specialRequestController.text, // ‚Üê AI Prompt
});
```

#### Search Hotels Screen Receives
```dart
_specialRequest = arguments['specialRequest'] as String? ?? '';
```

#### AI Agent Processing
```dart
await _api.sendMessage(
  'Hotel search query with special request'
);
```

## Features

### ‚úÖ **Implemented**
1. **Text Input Field** - Multi-line TextField for special requests

- Consider amenities, location, price, ratings
- Provide personalized suggestions

**User:** "I need a quiet hotel with good WiFi for work"
**AI:** "I'll search for hotels in Mumbai with excellent WiFi and quieter locations, avoiding party areas..."

**User:** "Budget hotel near railway station"
