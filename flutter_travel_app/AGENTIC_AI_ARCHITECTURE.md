# 🤖 Agentic AI Architecture - Google Gemini Integration

## Overview
This Flutter travel app implements a **true Agentic AI system** using **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**, mirroring the multi-agent architecture of the Python backend.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Manager Agent** (Coordinator)
- **File**: `lib/services/gemini_agent_manager.dart`
- **Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash (gemini-2.0-flash-exp)
- **Role**: Orchestrates all sub-agents, makes autonomous decisions

```
User Request → Manager Agent → Decides Which Sub-Agent → Executes Action → Returns Result
```

### **Sub-Agents** (Specialized Workers)
1. **hotel_booking** - Hotel search and booking
2. **travel_booking** - Flights, trains, taxis (placeholder)
3. **destination_info** - Attractions and activities (placeholder)

---

## 🧠 Agentic Behavior

### What Makes It "Agentic"?

1. **Autonomous Decision Making**
   - Manager analyzes user intent without explicit instructions
   - Decides which sub-agent to invoke
   - Example: User says "romantic hotel" → Manager extracts "honeymoon" context → Invokes hotel_booking with romantic filters

2. **Context Awareness**
   - Maintains conversation history
   - Remembers previous interactions
   - Adapts responses based on context

3. **Intelligent Routing**
   - Parses natural language → JSON decision
   - Routes to appropriate sub-agent
   - Handles clarification requests autonomously

4. **Self-Correction**
   - Falls back gracefully on errors
   - Asks clarifying questions when needed
   - Provides alternatives if primary path fails

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Step 1: User Input
```dart
User fills form:
- City: Goa
- Budget: ₹5000
- Special Request: "Need romantic beachfront hotel for anniversary"
```

### Step 2: Manager Analysis
```dart
Manager builds natural language request:
"Find hotels in Goa. under ₹5000. Special request: Need romantic beachfront hotel for anniversary"

Manager's AI Prompt:
- Analyzes intent
- Extracts context (anniversary = honeymoon trip)
- Identifies required sub-agent (hotel_booking)
- Determines parameters (romantic, beachfront, couples)
```

### Step 3: Manager Decision
```json
{
  "agent": "hotel_booking",
  "action": "search",
  "parameters": {
    "city": "Goa",
    "maxPrice": 5000,
    "ambiance": "romantic",
    "preferences": ["beachfront", "romantic", "couples", "anniversary"]
  },
  "reasoning": "User wants romantic beachfront hotel for anniversary",
  "needs_clarification": false
}
```

### Step 4: Sub-Agent Execution
```dart
Manager invokes hotel_booking sub-agent
↓
Searches mock database
↓
Finds matching hotels
↓
Generates AI explanation
↓
Returns results with reasoning
```

### Step 5: Response
```
Manager: "I found 5 romantic beachfront hotels in Goa perfect for your anniversary! 
The top picks offer stunning ocean views, private balconies, and couples spa packages. 
Would you like to see them?"

[Shows hotels in swipeable interface]
```

---

## 🎯 Key Agentic Features

### 1. Multi-Turn Conversations
```dart
User: "Find hotels in Mumbai"
AI: "For business or leisure?" [Clarification]
User: "Business meeting"
AI: *Automatically searches near business districts* [Autonomous action]
```

### 2. Intelligent Parameter Extraction
```dart
Input: "romantic hotel for honeymoon"
AI Extracts:
- tripPurpose: "honeymoon"
- occasion: "honeymoon"
- groupType: "couple"
- priorityFactors: ["ambiance", "location", "amenities"]
- mustHave: ["romantic ambiance", "couples amenities"]
```

### 3. Sub-Agent Coordination
```dart
Manager decides autonomously:
- Budget query → No sub-agent needed, handle directly
- Hotel search → Invoke hotel_booking
- Flight search → Invoke travel_booking
- Destination info → Invoke destination_info
```

### 4. Context-Aware Responses
```dart
Conversation History stored in manager:
[
  "User: Find hotels in Goa",
  "Manager: Here are 10 hotels in Goa",
  "User: Show me cheaper options",
  "Manager: *Remembers Goa context* Here are budget hotels in Goa"
]
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Manager Agent Code Structure
```dart
class GeminiAgentManager {
  // Gemini 2.0 Flash model
  late final GenerativeModel _model;
  
  // Conversation history for context
  final List<Content> _conversationHistory = [];
  
  // Main entry point
  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> processUserRequest({
    required String userMessage,
    Map<String, dynamic>? context,
  })
  
  // Decision making
  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _getManagerDecision()
  
  // Sub-agent invocation
  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _executeAgentAction()
  
  // Specialized sub-agents
  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _invokeHotelAgent()
  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _invokeTravelAgent()
  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _invokeDestinationAgent()
}
```

### Prompt Engineering
```dart
System Prompt for Manager:
- Defines sub-agent capabilities
- Provides decision-making rules
- Specifies JSON output format
- Includes examples for few-shot learning
- Enforces agentic behavior patterns
```

## 🚀 Advantages Over Traditional Search

### Traditional Approach:
```
User fills form → Simple keyword matching → Shows results
```

### Agentic AI Approach:
```
User fills form 
↓
Manager analyzes intent (AI understands "anniversary" = romantic + special occasion)
↓
Manager decides hotel_booking is needed
↓
Manager invokes hotel_booking with enhanced parameters
↓
hotel_booking searches with AI-enhanced criteria
↓
Manager generates personalized explanation
↓
User sees intelligent results with reasoning
```
