## 📱 How to Run

### Backend (Already Running)
```bash
cd "7-multi-agent"
python manager/agent.py
# API running on http://localhost:8000
```

### Flutter App
```bash
cd flutter_travel_app

# Install dependencies (already done)
flutter pub get

# Run on Android emulator
flutter run

# Or run on Chrome (for quick testing)
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Test Flow
1. Splash screen (3 sec) → Home
2. Tap "Swipe to Discover" → Swipe cards
3. Swipe 5+ items → Check insights (ML feedback)
4. Tap "Search Hotels" → Fill filters → Search
5. Tap a hotel → (Detail screen coming soon)
6. Bottom nav → "Bookings" → See list
7. Tap booking → QR code + Details

## 🐛 Known Issues
- Detail screens not implemented yet (tap on hotel/booking shows nothing)
- No actual images (using placeholders/icons)
- Budget/Profile screens are placeholders
- Need to add error handling everywhere
- Loading states needed in more places

## 💡 Suggestions for Demo
1. **Pre-populate some data** in backend so searches work
2. **Create sample bookings** to show QR codes
3. **Add budget entries** to show charts
4. **Swipe 10+ times** before demo to show ML stats
5. **Have backend running** before starting app
6. **Use Android emulator** for best experience (iOS needs different setup)

## 🎨 Design Consistency
All screens follow EaseMyTrip style:
- **Deep Blue** (#231F9E) primary color
- **Red** (#E73C33) accent for important actions
- **Orange** (#EF6C00) for highlights
- **Poppins** font throughout
- **Gradients** on headers
- **Card-based** layouts
- **Smooth animations** everywhere
