## ⚠️ Current Status: API Key Expired

Your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable is set, but the key has **expired**.

### **To Fix (Get New API Key):**

1. **Visit**: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. **Click**: "Create API Key" or "Get API Key"
3. **Copy** the new key (starts with `AIza...`)
4. **Set** environment variable:

```powershell
# In PowerShell (temporary - this session only)
$env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE"

# Or add to system permanently:
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('GOOGLE_API_KEY', 'YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE', 'User')
```

5. **Restart** the server:
```powershell
cd "c:\Hack2skill\Hack2skill finale\7-multi-agent"
python -m uvicorn api_server:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
